1.
fixHeadTail.h:

if mismatches generated when fixIndel at ends, insert mismatch vec 2 alignInfo

 
2. 
fixHeadTail nwdpBesideReadEnd

3.
when detecting circular RNAs, 
enable remapping, target mapping, greedy mapping .... in fixHeadTail,
rewrite the newAlignInfo generating problem

in align_info.h:

newAlignInfoAfterAddHeadInfo2SoftClippingAlignment_new(

as "splice Junction Distance < 0" can be introduced by circular RNA

4.

 make sure MPS3 is using alignInferJuncHash


5. to do 09/12/2015

a). For cirRNA:

i). make MPS3_cirRNA favor normal alignments instead of reporting all possible ones including back-splicing reads;

ii). write a script to reFormat alignment results: split back-splice reads to make it avaliable to visualize them through IGV;

iii). generate cirRNA transcirpts and its read count, them call DESeq2 to do differentially analysis on the three samples.

b). For Fusion:

i). simulate fusion transcripts with FUSIM;

ii). simulate reats from both normal reads and fusion reads.

6. to do 09/18/2015

For Gene Count: (alignAll_geneCount.cpp)

i). initiate_andGenerateGeneSetInfo() in transcript2geneMap_info.h

ii). peAlignInfo_transcript.doGeneCount() in alignAll_geneCount.cpp
